NASWA History.py - The code to get the file and apply the region crosswalk
naswa.xlsx - The output file NASWA History.py writes to, currently truncated
             to 20 rows.  It will be overwritten if the script is run.
NLx Research Hub API Overview.docx - The original documentation
ziptoedr - a crosswalk of zip codes to counties and Economic Development Regions
             for Minnesota


Known issues to work around: 

Nationally, wages can only be derived for about 10% of job postings 
and maybe shouldn't be aggregated.

In Minnesota, zip codes for Saint Paul and Mankato (both substantial cities) 
were rolled into combined zip codes not present in the crosswalk and had to 
be manually added.  Check the unmatched rows for anomalies.

The structured variables aren't very frequently populated.  With some work they 
can be derivied from long descriptions.  The only two that yielded good enough 
results for us nationally were experience and education.  Education is also one 
of the structured variables that seems to be more frequently populated.

The API limits you to 35 days of history, meaning you have to make multiple calls 
to get the historical series.  So far I haven't been successful at getting a 
multiple year series for MN because certain months return an empty rowset.  That 
might be because I've made a lot of calls at once or because they're large files or 
because something about my date specification isn't working.  

Coverage isn't consistent between states, but all states have data.  The sources 
and volume of openings vary.
